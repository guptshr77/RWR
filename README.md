# RoadWorthy Resale
This was a final project for a Database Management Systems course. This application is a car resale platform. This application allows a user to create an account, log in, and search cars in different ways (search by brand, my likes, and other keywords), create a new listing of a car you wanna sell, and interact with the listings.

# installation
There are 2 parts to this application. There is the Backend and Frontend, both in this repository. They are set up to communicate through restapi. So when setting this up, the frontend should be running in a separate window of the IDE from the backend.
